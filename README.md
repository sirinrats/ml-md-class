# Introduction

This repository contains the materials for the paper titled: Applied Machine-Learning Models to Identify Spectral Sub-Types of M Dwarfs from Photometric Surveys (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/acc974).

### CDS8 Prediction Results
The results are provided in the directory `cds8_res/`. It can be downloaded by:

```
curl -o cds8_pred_results.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirinrats/ml-md-class/main/cds8_res/cds8_pred_results.csv
```

### Models
The default models are provided in the directory `models/`.

The models trained with Random Undersampling (RUS) are provided in the directory `models/models_rus`.

### Confusion Matrices
All confusion matrices are provided in the directory `cmats`.

### Examples of input data (to be predicted) 
See examples of input (format and order of feature columns used for each model) in the directory `example_input/`.
